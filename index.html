<p>This site is was created to help people to understand distributed version control systems (DVCS) and their use.  I am using Git as it has become the de facto standard for DVCS.  DVCS are not only a better form of revision control, but a different approach.  This means that you need to think differently about the changes you are making when using a DVCS than you would with a revision control tool.  As a result this site focuses on the concepts that are important while using a DVCS.  Yes I do go through the commands, but my intent is to introduce you to the ideas that will make working with a DVCS tool convenient.
  When I first started to look at DVCS, I was using a tool called Mercurial.  It is similar to Git, thought there are differences.  I muddled around in Mercurial for a while until I found Joel Spolsky’s tutorial <a href="http://hginit.com">http://hginit.com</a>.  It is an excellent tutorial on using DVCS that uses Mercurial commands (all of which start with hg, the elemental symbol for mercury).  So when my office decided to move to Git I thought I would just find the Git version of his site and share that link.  I was not able to find such a site.  Don’t misunderstand me, there are many excellent Git tutorial’s on the web.  They all address the concepts associated with DVCS to a greater or lesser extent.  In fact I have some of them listed at the end of this tutorial.  Still most are quite extensive (40+ pages).  I wanted something that would help people starting thinking about changes in the right way quickly.</p>
<p>  Let’s get started understanding distributed version control with Git.</p>
