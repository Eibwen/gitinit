## Next Steps

  Now that you have an idea how Git works.  What are the next steps?  First you need to use Git.  I recommend spending a little time using the command line tools.  This will help you to become comfortable with the concepts you have learned.  The danger that the various GUIs for Git have is that they often use different terms.  This is fine until you want to ask a question of someone else.  If you are not speaking the same language (using the same words) then you are going to end up frustrated and not get an answer to your question.
  After you spent some time with the command line go ahead and get a GUI tool is you like.  Also after you have become comfortable with what you've learned and you want to know more about Git, or you need a reminder about how a command works, take a look at these resources.
